## 1️⃣ Project Objective & Architecture

* **Goal:** Predict whether a student will **Pass (1)** or **Fail (0)** an exam based on the number of hours they studied using a binary classification model.
* **Architecture Flow:**

## 2️⃣ Step 1: Problem Definition & Dataset

* **Feature ($X$):** Study Hours (Input Matrix, Shape `(10, 1)`)
* **Target ($y$):** Exam Result (0 = Fail, 1 = Pass)

### Dataset Table:
| Student # | Study Hours ($X$) | Actual Label ($y$) | Meaning |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | `[1]` | `0` | Fail |
| 2 | `[2]` | `0` | Fail |
| 3 | `[3]` | `0` | Fail |
| 4 | `[4]` | `1` | Pass |
| 5 | `[5]` | `1` | Pass |
| 6 | `[6]` | `1` | Pass |
| 7 | `[7]` | `1` | Pass |
| 8 | `[8]` | `1` | Pass |
| 9 | `[9]` | `1` | Pass |
| 10 | `[10]` | `1` | Pass |

```python
x = [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]]
y = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```

---

## 3️⃣ Step 2: Import Scikit-Learn Modules

We import the required modules from Scikit-Learn:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import (
    accuracy_score,
    confusion_matrix,
    precision_score,
    recall_score,
    f1_score,
    classification_report
)
```

---

## 4️⃣ Step 3: Train / Test Split

We allocate **80%** of the data for training and **20%** for unbiased evaluation:

```python
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    x, 
    y, 
    test_size=0.2, 
    random_state=42
)

print(f"Training samples : {len(x_train)}")
print(f"Testing samples  : {len(x_test)}")
```

---

## 5️⃣ Step 4: Model Instantiation & Training

```python
# 1. Create Model Object
model = LogisticRegression()

# 2. Train on Training Data
model.fit(x_train, y_train)
```

> 💡 **What Happens During Training?**  
> The model finds the best weights ($m$) and intercept ($b$) to map study hours through the Sigmoid function:  
> $$P(\text{Pass}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(mx + b)}}$$

---

## 6️⃣ Step 5: Test Predictions & Comparison

```python
prediction = model.predict(x_test)

print("Actual Test Labels    :", y_test)
print("Model Predicted Labels:", prediction)
```

### Sample Output:
```text
Actual Test Labels    : [0, 1]
Model Predicted Labels: [0, 1]
```
Both test samples were correctly classified by the model!

---

## 7️⃣ Step 6: Full Evaluation Metrics Suite

```python
# Accuracy
acc = accuracy_score(y_test, prediction)
print(f"Accuracy         : {acc * 100:.2f}%")

# Confusion Matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, prediction)
print("Confusion Matrix :")
print(cm)

# Precision, Recall, F1-Score
precision = precision_score(y_test, prediction)
recall    = recall_score(y_test, prediction)
f1        = f1_score(y_test, prediction)

print(f"Precision Score  : {precision * 100:.2f}%")
print(f"Recall Score     : {recall * 100:.2f}%")
print(f"F1 Score         : {f1 * 100:.2f}%")
```

### Metrics Output Breakdown:
```text
Accuracy         : 100.00%
Confusion Matrix :
[[1 0]
 [0 1]]
Precision Score  : 100.00%
Recall Score     : 100.00%
F1 Score         : 100.00%
```

> ⚠️ **Note on Small Datasets:**  
> Because our sample dataset is small and easily separable, the model achieves 100% accuracy. On large, noisy real-world datasets, scores will be lower and more varied.

---

## 8️⃣ Step 7: Real-World Prediction for New Students

Now we use the trained model to predict outcomes for new students:

### Case: A student studying 6 hours
```python
new_student_hours = [[6]]

predicted_class = model.predict(new_student_hours)
predicted_probs = model.predict_proba(new_student_hours)

status = "Pass" if predicted_class[0] == 1 else "Fail"

print(f"Study Time   : 6 Hours")
print(f"Prediction   : Class {predicted_class[0]} ({status})")
print(f"Probabilities: Fail = {predicted_probs[0][0]*100:.1f}%, Pass = {predicted_probs[0][1]*100:.1f}%")
```

### Output:
```text
Study Time   : 6 Hours
Prediction   : Class 1 (Pass)
Probabilities: Fail = 10.4%, Pass = 89.6%
```

## 🎯 Day 3 Master Interview Revision

### 1. What is classification in Machine Learning?
> **Answer:**  
> Classification is a supervised learning technique that assigns input data into predefined discrete categories or classes (e.g., spam vs non-spam).

### 2. What algorithm did we use for binary classification?
> **Answer:**  
> Logistic Regression. It predicts the probability of a categorical outcome by passing linear values through the Sigmoid activation function.

### 3. What is the difference between `predict()` and `predict_proba()`?
> **Answer:**  
> `predict()` outputs discrete class labels based on a decision threshold, while `predict_proba()` outputs the raw probabilities for each class.

### 4. Why is Accuracy alone not enough for evaluation?
> **Answer:**  
> On imbalanced datasets, a model that simply predicts the majority class can yield high accuracy while completely failing to detect the minority class.

### 5. What is a Confusion Matrix?
> **Answer:**  
> A table evaluating model performance by displaying counts of True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, and False Negatives.

### 6. What is False Positive vs False Negative?
> **Answer:**  
> * **FP (Type I error):** Model falsely predicted positive when the actual class was negative (False alarm).  
> * **FN (Type II error):** Model falsely predicted negative when the actual class was positive (Dangerous miss).

### 7. What is Precision?
> **Answer:**  
> The proportion of predicted positives that were actually positive: $\frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FP}}$.

### 8. What is Recall?
> **Answer:**  
> The proportion of actual positives that were correctly caught: $\frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FN}}$.

### 9. What is F1-Score?
> **Answer:**  
> The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall: $2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}$.

### 10. Why use Train/Test Split?
> **Answer:**  
> To train the model on one portion of the data and evaluate its ability to generalize on unseen data, preventing overfitting and data leakage.
